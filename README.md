# Carfree Commute

This app was created to allow a user to keep track of the miles they travel on foot, by bike, bus, and BART, as well as the emissions they save by choosing human-powered or public transit.

# Backend

This is an Ember-cli app that is connected with a Rails backend API. The code for the API is [here](https://github.com/tophat8855/gProject-API)

# Features

All of the features for calculating the miles traveled and emissions are available even if you are not signed in. The ability to save a trip and see the record of your trips requires login. 

Signing up is currently in progress- hopefully availabe in the next week.

Chart.js is used for displaying pie charts for totals of miles traveled and emissions saved by mode of transportation.
